# RDF Context Associations Demonstrator

This repository houses the demonstrator for the RDF Context Associations demonstrator.

**The demonstrator can be found [here](https://knowledgeonwebscale.github.io/rdf-context-associations-demo/)**

The demonstrator Website consists of a **Contextualization interface**,
for which a Linked Data Document of choice can be added and a selection of metadata is made available.

A second **Processing interface** can ingest both normal RDF sources and sources enriched with context associations.
It provides filtering options and shows the resulting query and information complying to the filter.
